    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <p>Foundation and early years
        Munster was officially founded in 1879, at the same time as Leinster and Ulster, with Connacht being founded ten
        years later in 1889. The first interprovincial matches between Leinster, Ulster and Munster, however, were held
        in 1875. The founding of the Munster branch of the IRFU was intended to organise and oversee the game within the
        province and prevent any club bias by providing neutral selectors for the representative side. In amateur days,
        the four Irish provinces played against each other in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship and also played
        touring international sides
        Munster traditionally drew its strength from the clubs of Limerick, with the game popular in the city and widely
        played at all levels. Teams such as Shannon, Garryowen and Young Munster built up fierce rivalries with one
        another, helping push standards in the province higher as a result.</p>
